My HTML and CSS Projects

This is where I practiced and creating HTML and CSS Projects on my boot camp

I built two sample sites
  
  * Shakespeare adventure [Shakespeare Adventure website/index.html]
      This is an example webpage for a travel tour. I used css to create a navigation bar, image container and contact form. 
  * Academy cinemas [https://github.com/JackRM10/Jack-HTML-and-CSS-Projects/blob/main/bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html]
      This webpage was created using bootstrap. Using bootstraps I created a jumbotron, nav bar, cards, anchors and drop down menu.
